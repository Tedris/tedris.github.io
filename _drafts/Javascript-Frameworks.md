title: Javascript Frameworks
---
Hey everyone, trying a post from an Android mobile app today, so if it looks funny, I'll have to mess with it.

Let's talk a little bit about Javascript frameworks, personally I have a lot of experience with ExtJS and AngularJS 1.x and feel like Angular is the better of the two.

I'm not entirely sure what I like about Angular so much, maybe it's the fact that I'm able to see what's going on, or the fact that it's open source.  Picking between the two, it's clear that Angular is the winner.

I haven't tried React yet, so I can't comment on that, but I have heard good things about it.

For full Javascript stacks, I've messed with Meteor, but haven't checked out MEAN stack yet.  If I needed both a frontend and backend for a project, I'd likely go with an Angular frontend with a Spring Boot backend, I know I'm still sticking with Java in that case, but it's too good not to use since it scales so well.

Once I find out how to add comments here, I'll ask for other people's thoughts.
