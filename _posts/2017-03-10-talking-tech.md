I feel like I went through a sort of crisis.  I was thinking maybe my game would be better served being written in a more high performance language, but at the same time I wanted to see just how well Electron would do. 

At the very least if I do want to change my tech, I think the code that I'm writing is very portable, though I would prefer it to be a sort of write once run everywhere sort of thing, and I would also prefer to stay away from Unity for the time being.

It's tough coming up with an underlying technology.  I was thinking of just what my project would require but there are so many different languages that are suitable, that picking something else would only be good as a matter of performance, and would the UI be as easy to write?

I don't know, I would rather just stay the course and if it's wrong, it's wrong.  One of these days I'll put it on github so everyone can see and comment.

Maybe I'll get around to adding a disqus here or something.  Or maybe I'll use Reddit.
