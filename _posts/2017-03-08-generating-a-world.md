title: Generating a world
---

I am not sure if it's the smartest idea or not but I thought I would start my prototype with World generation.  Once I get some random name generation going, I can name things like monsters and npcs, maybe come up with algorithms for what kind of items they should be carrying based on level.

Getting a feel for this is kind of tough, it's difficult to say whether I'm doing the right thing, or if I should even be writing this in Electron but this is what I'm starting with.  At the worst I can always switch to another language using what I have, so long as I document it properly.  I wanted to make sure I at least get my thoughts down here so work can be traced.  Not sure if I'm leaving this more as a project blog or a general blog but I'll try to keep content interesting.

Maybe one day I'll have something to show here, or at the very least people will be able to look at my code and mess with it themselves.

This is fun!

I hope you all have as much fun with your personal projects as I have!
