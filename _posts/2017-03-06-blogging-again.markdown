I almost forgot about this thing.  I've been messing with Electron lately so I think I'll keep updating my progress on this site if anything looks good.  At the very least I'll keep writing.

Boy, a year's passed by.  Life's been busy, I learned a lot about Angular.  I don't think I'll use it on this site since I want to keep it as fast as possible.  Maybe I'll change the layout.

Hopefully I'll get something going for a personal project.  At the very least I'll keep blogging here about interesting stuff that I've been reading about.  I had read this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5xmu09/developers_apart_from_your_95_or_studying_what/ and thought about this site and how I should be writing here more.

Maybe I'll add comments or maybe a subreddit, I'll just see how it goes.  First thing is to get into the habit of writing and then I'll have more to talk about.
