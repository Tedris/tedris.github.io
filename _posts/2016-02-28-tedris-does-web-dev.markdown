Hey everyone!  Let's talk about what I do for a living.

I'm a programmer, pretty cool right?  So far putting up this site is far easier than anything I work on though.

Let's talk about text editors and IDEs I've tried:

1) Sublime Text

This is awesome.  It's fast, it has a lot of plugins, and you can be very efficient once you learn the shortcuts.  People would argue the same for VIM and EMACS, but Sublime gives you more functionality out of the box.

2) Eclipse

I've been using Eclipse since 2004.  It can be slow and monolithic, or it can be small and sleek, it all matters how many plugins you install and what you're trying to do with it.  Keep it as barebones as possible and it can be a pretty quick IDE.  I use it mainly for Java development and remotely connect to my local servers as the IDE server plugins tend to make Eclipse freeze, or maybe that's just my work laptop not having the necessary power.  When working on my portal integration code I have to have both a Websphere and a Weblogic server up, so most of my resources are tied up in that.  Maybe there's a better way but I haven't read about it yet.

3) Visual Studio

I use this when I mess around with Unity and C#.  Solid IDE, but I don't use it as much as I use Eclipse so I can't comment too much on it.  Definitely better than MonoDevelop from what I've noticed.

4) Notepad++

Used to use this when I was doing PHP development years ago.  Great text editor especially when dealing with properties files.  Sublime is better for dealing with code though.

5) Brackets

I used this briefly when I was working with ExtJS before switching to Sublime.  Has some neat parts about it but is generally slower than Notepad++ or Sublime.  Nice alternative to developing Javascript in Eclipse though as it does use less resources than an IDE.

6) Atom.io

Lots of plugins, but slower than Sublime Text.  Still needs time to mature.

7) Visual Studio Code

Appears to be faster than Atom, comes with Intellisense, still slower than Sublime Text.  Maybe it's the fact that it's using electron instead of C, I don't know what's going on beneath the hood with these javascript based programs but it still appears to be slower than something developed natively.  Maybe it's just that Sublime is coded better.

I'll see if I can write more about languages later today, going to be pretty busy.  Yep, busy busy stuff going on.
