So I'm thinking let's go easy.  GameDev is tough and I have limited time.  Hell I have to fight to get myself to do webdev outside of work.  Maybe it's because I dev all the time and don't always feel like doing it.

But I want to make a game.  Always wanted to be a game developer.  So I'm starting small.  I think I'll start with a sudoku game for Windows/Linux/Android and build it in LibGDX, then write a solver for it.  Then for stretch goals maybe think about using that solver to make some particularly difficult puzzles.

To new devs out there, start small and easy, work your way up, pick a language and familiarize yourself with it.  Remember, it can be anything!  I've been working with Java since late 2003 and I have a hard time getting away from it (hence LibGDX).

Good luck out there with all of your projects!
