I'm at a loss here, internet.  For a while I've been looking at different projects, but nothing seems to really want to jump out at me.  I thought about making a game in Unity but no idea really seems to stick.  Looked at Haxe and LibGDX and the same happened.  I'm still thinking of at least trying to make some small 2D game with LibGDX but I'm not really sure what it should be, like a space shooter or maybe a small SIM game.

I have ideas, lots of ideas.  I'm not an ideas guy, I'm a programmer, so you'd think that maybe I could get something workable down but it's hard to do with limited free time.  I don't work in the gaming industry because it's more hours and less pay from what I'm doing now.  Actually from what I'm seeing on Glassdoor, it's a considerable difference, though it looks like I do make more than the average web developer around here.

It's nice having a blog, I thought about it for a while, but it's good to work with code and actually work on a blog more like a developer would, I'm not doing anything fancy here like with AngularJS, but I like how the simplicity of the blog gives it a sort of parity between desktop and mobile.  Seems like basic sites do well like that, and because it's not javascript heavy it's rather performant with serving pages.

Anyway, I'm kind of all over the place.

Tons of ideas, not enough time to implement them.  I was thinking of a Ragnarok Online style MMO in Unity, or maybe an Action RPG, once tried something but I had issues with getting the AI to work with the procedurally generated world.  If I tried again, I'd want the world to be premade, it would be easier to just bake the navmesh into the world that way.

Working on getting a comments section set up, that might happen today or it might be some other time, but it's neat just working on a little blog that doesn't take a lot of work.
