Hey everyone, I've been thinking about a game I want to write.  I have a lot of the preliminary thoughts but I wanted to write this first to see if it made sense.

One thing I need to figure out is how I'm going to save all my character information.  I was thinking I don't really care if people decide they want to edit the save file or not so I thought I would just use JSON to do it.  Will see if this is a good idea later and may go for a more robust solution.

Point is I'm writing a progression based game where you tell your character what to do and they do it.  It's almost like you're running a bot except without the fear of getting banned.  I was initially going to write just an auction house type app for people to post and buy fake RPG items, but thought it would be good to add a system for getting those items in the beginning and maybe add the auction house later as an add-on that reads from the same save file.  Would need to be able to handle cases where it might write to or read from the save file at the same time to avoid duping scenarios.

Kind of a neat thought experiment!

Anyway since I'm more or less using an MMO as the idea for the simulator, I was going to break it up into different zones that the player would be leveling in, maybe figure out how long it should take per level.  Still mainly in the thought and brainstorming stages, will post more images here.

Also thinking about making it open source so people can either contribute or come up with their own ideas, would be a great collaborative effort!

Anyway, good luck to all of you, and good luck with your projects!
