So I'm going to try a gaming post here.  Maybe talk about some stuff I've been playing lately, see if I can embed some stuff, figure out markdown, etc.

Haven't done this stuff since I worked on a custom blog a long time ago, so it's interesting to work on something a little more mature with actual conventions and everything, plus no PHP!

So here's some stuff I've been doing in Minecraft:

Oh man, that was neat.  I think I like how this works so far, maybe I'll figure out how to make the page look a little neater and maybe put the posts in a better format to get to all the articles.

Well, I mean if people care about that sort of thing.

So for Minecraft, I generally play modpacks, rarely do I go through Vanilla Minecraft anymore.  There's usually so much more involved and even though it seems like it's way over my head sometimes, I prefer it to what can be limiting with standard Minecraft.  For example, I like being able to sort things since I'm usually terrible with organization.  Even this site is using the default format and I'm trying to make sure not to clutter it up too much.

I thought about working on my own pack, but so far it seems like an amateur effort compared to what I've seen out there.  Plus it seems like I get in the middle of making something and find something better out there.  At least a blog is usually unique content.

Anyhow I'll post more when I find the time, for now I'll read more into what I can do with Jekyll and how I can make this site look a little neater.
